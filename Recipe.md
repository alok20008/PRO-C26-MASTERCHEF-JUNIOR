Process to make chicken burger 

METHOD

STEP 1
Put the chicken breast between two pieces of cling film and bash with a rolling pin or pan to about 1cm thick.
Mix the chipotle paste with half the lime juice and spread over the chicken.

STEP 2
Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. Once hot, cook the chicken for 3 mins each side until cooked through,
adding the cheese for the final 2 mins of cooking. Add the bun, cut-side down, to the griddle pan to toast lightly. Season the chicken.

STEP 3
Meanwhile, mash the avocado with the remaining lime juice. Stir in the cherry tomatoes, jalape√±o and garlic,
and season with a little salt. Spread over the base of the bun, then add the chicken followed by the top of the bun.

That's all enjoy :)
